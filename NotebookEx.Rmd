## Here is an example of an R Markdown document

  - Introduction presentation
  - Island tour

## Coconut Island

```{r}

hist(rnorm(100))
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
